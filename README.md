# z

Welcome to Z! This project will be based on Rust, Zig and Go. Important goals are:

- Native code
- Fast compilation
- Simplicity like Go
- Enums like Rust
- Error and null handling like Zig
- Memory management with implicit allocators, or garbage collector

It uses QBE as a backend compiler, and TinyCC for compiling.
I hope we can achieve incremental compilation like in Zig with our own compiler backend.
But that's just a dream.. for now.
